# Notes for Computational Biology with Nick Gotelli

# Clear memory of characters:
ls()

###Learning about R markdown comands:

This text has *italics*.

This text is **bold**.

### Headers:


### Third Header

## Second Header

# First Header

These     words     are widely      Spaced

Add spaces to end of words to make list (3)

Object 1   
Object 2   
Object 3   

##Lists

- First
- Second
    + Indented Item
    + Idented Item

**Block Quotes:**

A friend once said:

> It's always better to give 
> than to receive.


**Fencing** Shows PLain Text:

```
Now I can     add random     spaces
```

**Tables:**

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell


**Inline R Code**
There were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied

```{r}
# Comments:

Time <- seq(1,10) # seq makes integer sequence!
print(Time) # PRINT IT!

Resp <- runif(10) # get 10 random numbers
print(Resp) # print it

plot(x=Time, y=Resp, type="b") # plot them
```

### LaTex Equations

$a = b + c$

Here it is centered:

$$a = b + c$$

### More on Latex Equations:

**Subscripts:**

$$x_t + t_{first}$$

**Superscripts:**

$$x^t + t^{first}$$

**Special Symbols:**

$$\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma+\delta_x}$$

**Using the backslash:**

$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

**Summation sign:**

$$z = \sum_{i=1}^X{K}$$

**Rendering plaintext in LaTeX:**

$$P(\mbox{Occurance of species A}) = Z$$

## R code chunk:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(runif(20))
print(seq(1,5))
```

###using grep and general expression to manipulate data:

* Literal
* metacharacters
* "Escaping the metacharacter"
```
    - \.
    - \\
```
* wildcards 
```
    - "\w" a songle "word" character (all caps, all lower case, 0-9)
    - "\d" a single number character (0-9)
    - "\t" a single tab space
    - "\s" a single tab, space or line break
    - "\n" a single line break
    -  "." single letters, digit, space
    - () surround everything we want to hang on to
```
* negated wildcards

```
    - "\W" anything thats not \w
    - "\D"not \d etc.
    - "\T" and "\S"
```
* creating our own custom character sets -> what follows is going to define my character set [A-Za-z]
* [ACTG] for genomic data
* Negate character sets [^A-Z] - anything but a capital letter 
* [^\t]=  anything accept a tab 
* quantifiers 
```
    - \w+ = 1 or more consectuative word characters 
    - + can we used with nay of the wild cards we have seen
    - \w* = 0 or more consecutive word characters 
    - \w{3} = exactly 3 consecuative word characters 
    - \w{3,5} = 3 4 or 5 that form a word
    - \w{3,} = 3 or more matches 
    - .* = get everything
```
