###Learning about R markdown comands:

This text has *italics*.

This text is **bold**.

### Headers:


### Third Header

## Second Header

# First Header

These     words     are widely      Spaced

Add spaces to end of words to make list (3)

Object 1   
Object 2   
Object 3

**Inline R Code**
There were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied

```{r}
# Comments:

Time <- seq(1,10) # seq makes integer sequence!
print(Time) # PRINT IT!

Resp <- runif(10) # get 10 random numbers
print(Resp) # print it

plot(x=Time, y=Resp, type="b") # plot them
```

## LaTex Equations

$a = b + c$

Here it is centered:

$$a = b + c$$
